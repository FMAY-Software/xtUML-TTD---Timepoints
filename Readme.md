# xtUML-TTD---Timepoints
  Using the time traveling debugger, time points may be persisted and compared with each other.

These time points can be create manually during a paused execution, or at the end of a completed execution. 

The captured data could then be compared against another time point using xtUML Model Compare.  This would provide a valuable tool in determining the cause for a regression failures.
